# CanGuard AI: 3-Tier Continuous Behavioral Authentication

**CanGuard AI** is a state-of-the-art, 3-tier continuous authentication system designed to secure mobile banking sessions after initial login. It continuously verifies a user's identity using typing biometrics, adding a powerful, unobtrusive layer of security that protects against session hijacking and account takeovers.

## Core Features

* **3-Tier Funnel Architecture**
  Dynamically adjusts the depth of security based on risk level for optimal performance and efficiency.

* **On-Device Intelligence (Tiers 1 & 2)**
  Ensures instant verification with zero network latency, while keeping all biometric data securely on the device.

* **Advanced Forensic Analysis (Tier 3)**
  Combines Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, and a Similarity Engine to detect sophisticated threats, including fraud rings and long-term takeover attempts.

* **High Performance, No Compromise**
  Maintains security without sacrificing application speed or user experience.

* **Immediate Effectiveness**
  Begins authenticating users accurately from the first session—no initial training period required.

* **Responsible and Inclusive AI**
  Adapts to user diversity and behavioral variations, minimizing false positives and supporting fairness.

## Architecture Overview

CanGuard AI processes behavioral data using a multi-stage security funnel. Each tier increases in complexity and computational cost, allowing the system to remain efficient while applying intensive checks only where needed.

| Tier | Name              | Description                                                                             |
| ---- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Fast Filter       | Lightweight heuristic model running on-device; clears over 95% of benign user behavior. |
| 2    | Deep Verification | On-device Siamese Network for personalized, context-aware behavioral biometrics.        |
| 3    | Forensic Analysis | Server-side AI ensemble (GNN, LSTM, Similarity Engine) used for high-risk events.       |

## Local Setup Instructions

To run the full CanGuard AI system locally, you will need to set up the following components:

* Python AI Server (Tier 3 analysis)
* Node.js Backend Server
* React Native Mobile Client

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn)
* Python 3.9+ and pip
* An ngrok account and auth token ([https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com))
* Expo Go app installed on your mobile device

---

### 1. AI Server (Python - Tier 3)

This component handles AI model inference and analysis.

```bash
# Navigate to the AI models directory
cd CanGuard-AI/AI-Models

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Flask server
python app.py
```

Leave this terminal running.

---

### 2. Backend Server (Node.js)

This server handles core application logic and communicates with the AI server.

```bash
# In a new terminal window:
cd CanGuard-AI/server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the server using nodemon
nodemon
```

Leave this terminal running as well.

---

### 3. Expose Backend with ngrok

Expose the Node.js server to the mobile client via a secure tunnel.

```bash
# In a third terminal window:

# Authenticate ngrok (only once)
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN

# Expose port 8000 (or the port your Node.js server is running on)
ngrok http 8000
```

Copy the `https://` forwarding URL generated by ngrok.

---

### 4. Mobile Client Setup (React Native)

Configure and run the mobile client using Expo.

```bash
# In a fourth terminal window:
cd CanGuard-AI/client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set the API endpoint
# Open: client/config/api.ts
# Replace the placeholder URL with your ngrok forwarding URL
# Example:
# const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app';
```

Now start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Scan the QR code in the terminal using the **Expo Go** app on your phone. The CanGuard AI app will launch and connect to your local servers.
